"Create your own custom dendrite pieces.  These pieces will be etched from stainless steel and come with an 18in sterling silver chain.  Since these are made to order please allow for 2-3 weeks before shipment.\n\nThe dendrite line is based off an algorithm called diffusion limited aggregation.  This process simulates randomly moving particles that attach with a certain probability when they collide.  This is similar to the way some types of corals grow.\n\nClick and drag on the small and large circle icons to change the size of the minimum and maximum circles.  Click and drag on the forces the make the pattern tend towards one direction.";
